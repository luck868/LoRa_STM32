@par Description

This directory contains a set of source files that implements a simple demo of an end 
device also known as a LoRa Object connecting to a LoRa Network. The LoRa Object can be 
   - LoRa ST 
   - or LSN50
By setting the LoRa Ids in comissioning.h file according to the LoRa Network requirements, 
the end device will send periodically the sensor data to the LoRa network.

@par Hardware and Software environment 


  - This example runs on STM32L072CZT6 devices.
    
  - This application has been tested with Dragino:
    LoRa ST
    LSN50
    boards can be easily tailored to any other supported device 
    and development board.

   
  - Connect the board to your PC with a USB-TTL
  -Set Up:

@par How to use it ? 
In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
  - Open your Serial Port Utility 
  - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
  - Run the example
  - Serial Port Utility Setting Config = 9600, 8b, 1 stopbit, no parity, no flow control ( in src/vcom.c)
